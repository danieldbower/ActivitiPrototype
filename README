TAG 00_BASE_INSTALL:  This is the minimum needed to run the Activiti Plugin.  Implemented following: https://code.google.com/p/grails-activiti-plugin/wiki/VacationRequestSampleApplication.

Additionally, I'm in the process of tweaking some of the templating code provided by the Activiti Plugin to make it conform to current Grails standards.

Running Tests: 
grails test-app 
will run some tests, including some heavily tweaked examples from the Activiti in Action book from Manning.

Run the Grails Activiti Plugin Vacation Request Example App
grails run-app  
You should then be able to follow the documentation at https://code.google.com/p/grails-activiti-plugin/wiki/VacationRequestSampleApplication
