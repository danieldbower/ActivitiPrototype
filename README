TAG 00_BASE_INSTALL:  This is the minimum needed to run the Activiti Plugin.  Implemented following: https://code.google.com/p/grails-activiti-plugin/wiki/VacationRequestSampleApplication.

Current Version:  Configured to use an EXTERNAL H2 instance instead of an embedded one.  This allows us to have a look at the database and run queries from a web browser.

Checkout this repository and run "grails run-app".  You should then be able to follow the examples.
